ideas for shaders and silhouette

refer to mushishi otherworldly stars episode
altar at the sea
okami boss darkness transition
could restore buildings/bring back things by destroying enemies like actraiser with dissolve shader (similar intro too?)
vignette for health/scene transitions

random ideas

THE WELL AT WORLD'S END?
refer to architecture
player can talk to buildings (padding, hold x to talk...)
on death shoot back through all levels to beginning?
ending, or infinite/generated levels -> no ending... think battle for wesnoth corrupted wizard/necromancer campaign with groundhog day thing for gameplay too
"weather" variation for themed/seasonal screens with light/particle effects
