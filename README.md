### About ###

This project is written in [Haxe](http://haxe.org/) and targets HTML5 using Yaroslav Sivakov's [three.js](http://lib.haxe.org/u/yar3333/) bindings. It requires a modern browser with WebGL support.

The style is inspired by the [Mushishi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushishi) manga.
