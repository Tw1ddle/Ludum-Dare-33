# Otherworldly Stars

Base code for my entry for Ludum Dare 33, the 48 hour game jam.

Play it [here](TODO) or visit the Ludum Dare [submission page](TODO).

### About ###

A HTML5/WebGL game with a graphical style inspired by the Ludum Dare 29 entry Beneath The Cave by [feiss](http://ludumdare.com/compo/author/feiss/) and the [Mushishi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mushishi) manga. It requires a modern browser with WebGL support to run.
